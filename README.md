## üìú News
üöÄ [2025.10] We will release all the code and pre-trained models to promote the research of semantic-aligned VAE for speech synthesis after cleaning the code.


## üí° Highlights
1. **Semantic Alignment**: A novel VAE framework that utilizes semantic alignment regularization to mitigate the reconstruction-generation optimization dilemma in high-dimensional latent spaces.
2. **Plug and Play for VAE-based TTS**: Semantic-VAE can be easily integrated into existing VAE-based TTS models, providing a simple yet effective way to improve their performance.
3. **Accelerated Training**: Semantic-VAE significantly accelerates the convergence of VAE-based TTS models while maintaining the same inference speed as the original models.
4. **High-Quality Speech Generation**: Semantic-VAE achieves high-quality speech generation with improved intelligibility and speaker similarity, making it suitable for various TTS applications.
5. **Open-Source**: Semantic-VAE is open-sourced to promote research in the field of speech synthesis and to provide a baseline for future work.
